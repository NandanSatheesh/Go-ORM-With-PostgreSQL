PostgreSQL was used for these examples. You can get a perfectly configured and optimized PostgreSQL databases ready in 2 minutes for free (20 MB of limited storage) from [Elephant SQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/).   

## Other Notes 
The keys in this project are shown for reference only and are disposed with care :tada:
